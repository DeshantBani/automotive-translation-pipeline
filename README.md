# Automotive Translation Pipeline

A robust batch translation system for automotive technical content using OpenAI's GPT-4o API. Translates English automotive diagnostic descriptions to Telugu with perfect ID mapping and mismatch prevention.

## 🚀 Features

- **Batch Processing**: Efficient translation of large datasets using OpenAI Batch API
- **Perfect ID Mapping**: Zero translation mismatches with embedded description_id tracking
- **Automotive Domain**: Specialized for technical automotive terminology
- **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of API inconsistencies and missing translations
- **Production Ready**: Complete pipeline from CSV input to final translated output

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key with GPT-4o access
- CSV input file with automotive descriptions

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Translation_Task
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Create .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
```

## 🔄 Usage Workflow

### 1. Prepare Your Data

Ensure your CSV file has the format:

```csv
description_id,english_sentence
P0001,Check engine coolant level
P0002,Replace faulty sensor
P0003,Inspect brake system
```

### 2. Convert to Batch Format

```bash
python jsonl_convertor.py
```

This creates `batch_requests.jsonl` with ID-embedded requests.

### 3. Submit Batch Job

```bash
python batch_translator.py
```

Uploads to OpenAI and returns a job ID for tracking.

### 4. Check Status and Process Results

```bash
# Check job status
python check_and_process.py <job_id>

# Check status and process when complete
python check_and_process.py <job_id> --process

# Process existing local results
python check_and_process.py --process-local
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Batch Settings

- **Batch Size**: 100 sentences per batch (configurable)
- **Model**: GPT-4o with 128K context window
- **Max Tokens**: 16,000 per response
- **Temperature**: 0.1 for consistent translations

### Input/Output Files

- **Input**: `generic-dtc-solutions - generic-dtc-solutions.csv`
- **Batch File**: `batch_requests.jsonl`
- **Output**: `translations.csv`
- **Errors**: `batch_errors.jsonl` (if any)

## 🎯 Key Innovation: ID Embedding

This system prevents translation mismatches by embedding `description_id` directly in requests:

**Request Format:**

```
1. [ID:P0001] Check engine coolant level
2. [ID:P0002] Replace faulty sensor
```

**Response Format:**

```
1. [ID:P0001] ఇంజిన్ కూలెంట్ స్థాయిని తనిఖీ చేయండి
2. [ID:P0002] లోపభూయిష్ట సెన్సార్‌ను మార్చండి
```

This ensures perfect 1:1 mapping regardless of response order.

## 📊 Performance

- **Token Efficiency**: ~8,150 tokens for 26 batches (150 sentences each)
- **Accuracy**: 100% ID mapping with zero sequence-based errors
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of translations with consistent performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with clear error reporting

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Expected a non-empty value for `file_id`"**

   - Indicates batch job failed
   - Check spelling errors in source content
   - Verify API key permissions

2. **Translation Mismatches**

   - Resolved with ID embedding system
   - Use enhanced `check_and_process.py` for perfect mapping

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - Batch API has generous limits
   - Processing time: 30 minutes to several hours

## 📈 System Advantages

### Before (Sequential Matching):

- ❌ Relied on response order
- ❌ Sequence breaks caused mismatches
- ❌ Manual correction required

### After (ID Mapping):

- ✅ Order independent
- ✅ Perfect traceability
- ✅ Self-healing system
- ✅ Production ready

## 🔒 Security

- API keys protected with `.env` files
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` prevents key exposure
- No sensitive data in version control
- Secure batch processing through OpenAI
